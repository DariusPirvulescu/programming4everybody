# *Ruby* overview:
# - Created by "Matz" in 1995
# - Super easy to pick up, @yukihiro_matz wanted a language that emphasizes human needs over those of computers, and created Ruby as close as possible to spoken english
# - 10 years later, in 2005, @dhh creates Ruby on Rails, an incredibly powerful framework ("extension" of a language) to build web applications
# - Today, Rails is used by a lot of famous companies like Github, Codecademy, Airbnb, and of course Le Wagon ðŸ˜Ž
# - At Le Wagon we teach how to build any web app you can think of. This course is just about Ruby, but you can always learn more! Check the readme â¬…

# Let's see it in action!

puts "1. *Data types*:"
puts 'Hello from Ruby!'.class # String
puts 10.class # Integer (natural number)
puts 1.50.class # Float (decimal with a dot, not a comma!)
puts true.class # TrueClass (boolean)
puts false.class # FalseClass (boolean)
puts nil.class # NilClass (no content, not yet assigned!)

# Quickly:
# 1. Strings to describe text
# 2. Integers and floats for numbers
# 3. Booleans for conditions
# 4. Nil if there is nothing, is not assigned
# + many more!

# Collections:
array = ["a string", 1, "another string", true, nil, []]

# To find an element I must know the index (position - 1)!
# Print the third element (I MUST know the order!):

# Strings

# Numbers

puts "#{number.to_f} is more precise though!" # to_f = to float (decimal)!
